						When humankind reached the Amazon, they were able to split up to go into separate tribes and created different cultures within the Amazon.
						From there multiple different groups of people began to inhabit the Amazon. Currently there are over 400 different Native American tribes, that live in the Amazon.
						</br>
						Many eurpoeans had visited the Amazon Rainforest, but the colonization was not a big issues until the 20th Century. Since then, the Amazon was being quickly cut down to support the 
						growing population. The overwhelming amount of people lead to the forest being cut down at rapid rates. 
						</br>Not only have colonization affect the Amazon as a whole, but disasters caused by humans have changed the once plentiful forest. The Amazon used to florish and was constantly healthy, but this has changed throughout the years. 
						</br>In the last half a century, 15% of the Amazon has been deforested. That is not a good thing for those that inhabit the Amazon and those that live on Earth in general.
						</br>If supporting the lives of the 400 native americans doesn't interest you, then maybe realizing that if you are taking care of the forest you are taking yourself will put you into action.
