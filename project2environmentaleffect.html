				The Amazon goes through many environmental issues, but the biggest one, is the issue of deforestation. 
				</br>
				</br>
				Deforestation doesn&#39t just affect the amount of trees a forest has, it affects the entire world. Many different species live in the Amazon, this means that many animals are losing their habits. 
				</br>
				</br>
				There is also an increase of greenhouse gases being released into the air. The Amazon provides 20% of oxygen in the world, since the rate that the Amazon is being chopped down, soon there won&#39t be any oxygen for the population. 
				</br>
				</br>
				The amount of trees in the Amazon help with the amount of water in the air. The trees absorb some of the water in the atmosphere which help control that amount of flooding and keeping fertile soil. Trees help the water cycle and provide water to the soil to ensure healthy crops.
