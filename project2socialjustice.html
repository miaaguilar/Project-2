					Despite the fact that Amazon houses multiple species and provides 20% of the worlds oxygen, many people aren&#39t taking the fall of the Amazon seriously. 
					</br>
					</br>
					The Amazon has around Native American 400 tribes. These tribes are affected every time there is a disaster. Deforestation and wildfires cause distress to those that live there, however, the Amazon doesn&#39t get as much help as other places.
					</br>
					</br>
					Notre Dame Cathedral had a fire and raised over 1 billion dollars, but the Amazon doesn&#39t get that kind of money. Why is that? I&#39ll leave you with that question.
					</br>
					</br>
					Support the Amazon to keep the Earth healthy.
